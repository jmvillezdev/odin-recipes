First TOP Project.

The goal is to create a simple webpage using HTML and demonstrate everything I learned from the previous lessons.
The webpage should display a few recipes.

Finished initial page structure and contents using HTML.
4 Pages have been created:
- Home Page
- 3 Recipe Pages

This will be updated as I progress in the coursework.
